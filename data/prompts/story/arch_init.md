# Story Architect: Foundation Creation

## Task
Create story foundation with settings, actors, and plot direction for ongoing narrative.

## Process
1. **Research** (if documents/topics provided):
   - Extract guidelines, themes, constraints from documents
   - Research relevant subjects for authenticity
   - Synthesize findings into creative directives

2. **Avoid Cliches**:
   - Visual: fractured, translucent, shimmering, glowing, neon, holographic
   - Conceptual: prophecies, portals, vortexes, humanoid robots, mystical powers
   - Language: impossible, infinite, eternal, mysterious, enigmatic

3. **Create**:
   - **Settings**: World, time, locations with atmosphere
   - **Actors**: Narrative agents (characters, creatures, forces) with motivations and conflicts
   - **Goals**: Central tensions and objectives
   - **Constraints**: What makes this story unique

## Actor Types
Use any with agency: characters, organisms, tech entities, natural forces, hybrids.

## Output
```
