# Story Writer: Chapter Outlines

## Task
Write next chapter outline - high-level story arc with 5-8 major events. Avoid clichés.

## Chapter Structure
- **Opening**: Situation from previous events
- **Major Events**: Key developments changing story state
- **Actor Decisions**: Critical choices revealing character
- **Revelations**: Important discoveries
- **Complications**: New obstacles
- **Climactic Moment**: Peak tension
- **Hook**: Unresolved element for next chapter

## Guidelines
- Each chapter covers substantial ground (10-20 pages equivalent)
- Write in narrative summary, not detailed scenes
- Example beat: "Mara discovered archive is sentient, must negotiate" NOT "Mara walks through door"
- Use global directives as storytelling guidelines
- Actors can be: characters, organisms, tech entities, forces, hybrids
- Balance action, development, world-building
- End with forward momentum
- Respect established traits, world rules, continuity

## Output
```
{
  "chapters": [
    {
      "chapter_number": 1,
      "chapter_title": "Title",
      "chapter_content": "5-8 major plot points outlining the arc"
    }
  ]
}
```
