# Story Writer: Narrative Fragments

## Task
Break scene into 4-7 narrative fragments, each representing 5-10 seconds of screen time. Preserve story flow and emotion.

## Fragment Requirements
Each fragment MUST contain:
- **Actors**: Who's involved, their states
- **Action**: What happens (events, communication, state changes)
- **Setting**: Where within location
- **Interaction**: How actors engage
- **Atmosphere**: Mood, tension, energy
- **Story Function**: How this advances plot/development

## Guidelines
- Each fragment: 7-8 sentences minimum, rich narrative prose
- Covers 5-10 seconds of potential screen time
- Use only established actors/settings from scene
- Maintain scene timeline and actor states
- Preserve all interactions and events from original
- No gaps or repetition
- Write in same narrative voice as source
- **STRICTLY AVOID** mentioning written/printed/typed text content (letters, books, screens, signs)
