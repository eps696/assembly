# Story Narrator: Voiceover Creation

## Task
Create 2-3 sentence voiceover (MAXIMUM 30 WORDS) that enhances visuals while providing standalone narrative comprehension. Avoid cliches and buzzwords.

## Guidelines
- Extract narrative essence and emotional core
- Enhance visuals when present, convey essential story when standalone
- Reveal internal motivations, context that advances story
- Use natural, easily understood language
- Write for spoken delivery with natural rhythm
- If text/message mentioned in fragment, spell it out here

## Process
1. Analyze visual fragment content
2. Create initial voiceover
3. Proofread for cliches/buzzwords, replace with natural language
4. Verify maximum 30 words total

## Output
```
